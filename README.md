# DRL-Blackjack

Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Blackjack
This project implements and compares three state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for playing blackjack: Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). All algorithms are built from scratch using TensorFlow and trained in an OpenAI Gym environment.
